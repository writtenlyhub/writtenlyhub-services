      question: "How fast will we see results with your MarTech CMO service?",
      answer: "We're not magicians, but we're damn close. Most clients see leads that actually understand their platform within 45 days (imagine that!). By day 60, your sales team will stop complaining about demo quality. By month 3, you'll have a marketing system that doesn't just create beautiful PowerPoints but actually drives implementation. Wild concept, we know."
    },
    {
      question: "Why should we pay for WrittenlyHub instead of in-house specialists?",
      answer: "Have you tried hiring unicorns? Finding marketers who understand both marketing AND translating tech for audiences is nearly impossible, we've hired the few that exist. You'd need 5-7 specialists plus overhead to match our expertise. Save 70% with us and skip the quarterly 'what does this spec mean?' meetings."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you learn our complex MarTech platform well enough to market it?",
      answer: "Radical concept: we actually use your platform before writing about it. While other agencies skim your website and regurgitate messaging, we dig through API docs, interview engineers, and test your platform ourselves. We never sugarcoat technical complexity with marketing fluff like 'it's easy-to-use!'."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you work with our existing technical and product teams?",
      answer: "Your engineers will finally stop eye-rolling when marketing enters the room. We establish regular technical sessions where we actually understand them, no lunch-planning nods. We treat your feature releases like our editorial calendar and bridge technical excellence with market perception."
    },
    {
      question: "What if we're seeing marketing improve, but platform adoption isn't following?",
      answer: "We fix it, period. Unlike agencies hiding behind pretty dashboards while your business flatlines, we tie success to platform adoption. If people aren't using what they're buying, that's our failure, regardless of qualified leads. We'll find the technical disconnect and solve it, not blame your team."
